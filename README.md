**Git ID** (or **gid**) is a simple, decentralized digital identity framework that enables users to publicly associate cryptographic keys with their GitHub profiles using standard Git repositories.

This repository includes a `gid.pem` file, which contains a public key used to bind a cryptographic identity to a GitHub account. By placing this key in a Git repository, users can prove control over both the private key and the associated GitHub identity.
